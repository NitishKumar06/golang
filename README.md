# Welcome

This repository is for practice and note taking purposes. In order to 
take the most advantage from this repository, here are **3 things that are 
highly recommended to be done**:

1. **Clone the Repo and Dry Run the code:** You don't have to type the exact 
code or copy-paste or even understand upto whatever the things have been mentioned.
Play with the code-base. Try doing weird things no matter how silly it sounds. Tha's how you learn!

2. **Google and Docs are your best friends:** While going through the code, you'll have tons of doubt
like 'Why did you do that', 'Hey! You didn't mention about these things', 'I'm getting and error' an 
other things at the same time. That's the reason I mentioned at the start is not to rely entirely on this 
repository. Instead use it as reference or for note taking purposes. Now, you will come across doubts - but
who's going to solve these doubts? Me? Not everytime. Maintainers of Golang or some specific community? Not everytime.
Then? YOU! Google and [Official docs](https://go.dev/doc/) are your best friends. Build the habit of reading blogs and docs.
Try finding the answer yourself first and then approach someone.

3. **Play with the Code:** As mentioned earlier, you've to play with the code-base. This generally means to get the code-base
available locally and then try understanding the things using first principle thinking. Question your own assumptions.
Why did I comment this thing? What will happen if I run this? Try and see it.

That's the only 3 things you need to take care of. Apart from that, feel free to add your own code via [Pull Request](https://github.com/NitishKumar06/golang/pulls)
and raise [issues](https://github.com/NitishKumar06/golang/issues) if you find anything wrong.
